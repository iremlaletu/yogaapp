### Yoga Club

This project is a Yoga Club web app built using React with Vite. It allows users to view yoga class schedules by country, displayed on a calendar. The app is front-end focused with no backend integration; data is fetched from MockAPI and displayed dynamically. I aimed to follow a modular design principle by focusing on clean structure, organized state, reusable components, and maintainable code.
